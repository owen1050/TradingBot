This is where Owen and Jason will make bank

Overall Idea: Analize top coins on some site (idk liek coinbase) for their activity on twitter and google trends and buy them on the up. Analize when to dump

Todo:  look into trading crypto api, get coin history for when it pops up we want to analize, overall strategy

Initial research:
- google trends: https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/
- twitter - this website is free and scrapeable https://www.hashtags.org/analytics/shib/
- binance api- https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#general-api-information
- python binance : https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

Current plan:
- once an hour refresh cryptos, look for volatile ones
- run lookback on volatile ones to find best paramaters
- trade on that until ????
